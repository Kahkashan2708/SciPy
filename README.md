# SciPy Tutorial Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the functionality of the [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) library in Python. SciPy is an open-source Python library used for scientific and technical computing. It builds on NumPy and provides a large number of higher-level functions for numerical integration, optimization, signal processing, linear algebra, statistics, and more.

##  Notebook Overview

The notebook included in this repository (`Scipy (1).ipynb`) covers the following topics:

-  **Optimization using `scipy.optimize`**
-  **Integration using `scipy.integrate`**
-  **Linear algebra operations using `scipy.linalg`**
-  **Interpolation using `scipy.interpolate`**
-  **Curve fitting and root finding**
-  **Practical examples with visualizations**

##  Requirements

Before running the notebook, make sure to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

##  Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/scipy-tutorial.git
    cd scipy-tutorial
    ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open and run `Scipy (1).ipynb`.

##  Sample Output

Here are a few things you will learn to do using SciPy:

- Solve systems of linear equations
- Perform definite and indefinite integration
- Find roots of equations numerically
- Fit data to a curve
- Visualize mathematical operations
